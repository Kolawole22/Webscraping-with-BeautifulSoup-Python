Data Analyst Junior  We are seeking a full-time Data Analyst Junior to join our team immediately. This position offers a highly interdisciplinary research experience, combining approaches from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, psychiatry, and statistics with neuroimaging. The applicant will have the opportunity to participate in major methodological and analytic developments, publications, and presentations.  Responsibilities will include supporting principal investigators, fellows, and technical staff with in-depth analyses using multiple complex datasets. While the position is entry-level (i.e. recent college graduates are encouraged to apply!), the analyst will work closely with a PhD-level statistician/psychometrician to climb very steep learning curves quickly. The analyst will thereby acquire an unusually advanced skillset compared to most entry-level positions.

Determine the statistical effects of missing data and compare the results of some available imputation methods (maximum likelihood, random forest, etc.).  2. Determine the number of latent dimensions underlying a data set and apply factor analysis and item response theory to estimate model parameters for such uses as computerized adaptive testing and analysis of item bias.  3. Demonstrate (visually) a statistical effect in several different ways (e.g. using panels versus color-coding).  4. Link a list of physical street addresses to geocodes and link those geocodes to census data from multiple years.  5. Simulate item responses with other variables to determine how many Likert response categories are likely to be necessary on a personality scale with a specific number of items.  The applicant is not expected to be familiar with the above-s/he will be taught-but it is important that at least some of the above procedures seem interesting to the applicant. Other duties might include: performing data management functions like extracting, importing, and exporting data from various in-house applications; restructuring and/or merging datasets; assisting with user documentation; running queries on datasets using SQL; preparing datasets for analyses; resolving data inconsistencies; and taking responsibility for completeness and quality of multiple data sets.  Qualifications  Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Physics, Statistics, Neuroscience or Experimental Psychology and 0-1 year of experience or equivalent combination of education and experience required.

200,Distance Sampling Data Analyst,Full-time,Na,"Distance Sampling Data Analyst NeededIntegrated Statistics is looking for a Distance Sampling Data Analyst to support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC).The Distance Sampling Data Analyst will assist NEFSC's Protected Species Branch (PSB) with the analysis of two disparate types of data on marine mammal distributions.PSB's mission includes assessing the population status of protected species (cetaceans, sea turtles, seabirds, and seals) within U.S. waters, and evaluating threats to species and populations due to anthropogenic activities. Detailed assessments of species distributions and abundances are essential to understand broad scale spatial and temporal movements and behaviors.

Their families can open and connect their own college savings account (separate from the scholarship account) and start saving their own money in the ways and amounts that make sense for them, building financial capability and stability. At the same time, communities can contribute to groups of these NYC Scholarship Accounts as both a targeted and universal platform for community-driven asset-building in every neighborhood. By combining seed scholarships, family savings, community investments, and funding streams from every level, the platform can build meaningful assets for public school students. These accounts, and the accompanying program supports, enable families, schools, local organizations, businesses, anchor institutions, financial institutions, philanthropy, and the public sector to work together to build assets in students’ accounts and strengthen social capital by supporting expectations of success across the neighborhood.

Diversity means recognizing that different views and experiences are as important as those we’re already familiar with. It means taking radical ownership of the things we affect as individuals and as a company - including even inherited ways of doing things which may be destructive or biased and which we must work to change. It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list. Diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.AZ, CA, GA, IL, IA, KS, MO, NY, NC, TN, TX, FL, MI, MAIf you are interested, send us your resume to jobs@magiclinks.com","Venice, CA"

Medical, Prescription, Behavioral Health, Dental, Vision, and Flexible Spending Accounts We understand how important health care is to maintaining a good quality of life. We also know our employees want to have the freedom to choose benefit plans to best meet their needs. Eligible employees may choose from four medical plan options, an HMO, PPO, and two HDHP (High Deductible Health Plans) with a health savings account. When employees enroll in medical coverage, they are automatically enrolled in prescription and behavioral health coverage as well. There are three dental plans from which to choose, two PPO plans and a pre-paid dental plan that functions like an HMO. As is the case with medical, the plans range in cost, flexibility, and network of providers. The vision plan provides employees and their covered dependents access to routine vision services and materials, including an annual eye exam. For those who wish to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible healthcare and dependent care expenses, the flexible spending accounts are suitable for that need.  Life and Disability Insurance  Because life sometimes takes unexpected turns, the County offers life insurance coverage to help employees and their loved ones in the event of death. Basic life and basic accidental death & dismemberment insurance equivalent to one times an employee's annual base salary is provided at no cost, with the option for employees to purchase additional coverage including spouse and child life insurance. Disability insurance is available to replace a portion of an employee's salary should they experience a short-term illness or injury.  Retirement  Eligible employees are covered by one of several State-sponsored retirement pension plans, including the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) and the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS). Additionally, there's the option to contribute to a 457(b) Savings Plan that provides employees with a variety of investment opportunities. For those employees who retire from the County and from their retirement system, and have accrued 1,000 or more hours of sick leave, the County makes a $10,000 contribution to a Post-Employment Health Plan set up on their behalf to be used for payment of eligible out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.  Group Legal Plan Maricopa County offers employees group discounts to purchase coverage for legal services such as adoptions, family matters, wills and trusts.  Wellness Maricopa County's Wellness Works program promotes health and wellness for employees and their families by focusing on physical activity, good nutrition, self-care and stress management. Maricopa County offers eligible employees a wellness incentive for completing required activities. By meeting a set of criteria, employees and their families can get reimbursed for participating in a Weight Watchers Program. On-site fitness facilities and fitness classes are provided to employees at various locations around the County. Employees and their families also have the opportunity to receive a discounted fitness club membership at LA Fitness. Employees have access to smoking cessation programs and health-related classes on various topics including nutrition, exercise and stress management. Employees located downtown benefit from an onsite pharmacy and clinic. Every fall, flu vaccines are offered to employees at various County locations.   Employee Assistance Program (EAP) When employees and their families are faced with personal issues, confidential, short-term counseling and referral services are available to them at no cost.   Employee Discounts Maricopa County subscribes to a service association which provides employees with volume discounts for sporting events, entertainment, and many other services.  Commute Options Program (COP)  Maricopa County provides free Valley Metro passes for the bus and light rail systems for commuting to/from work; a vanpool subsidy is also provided. Employees can decrease stress, decrease wear and tear on their vehicle and help the environment all at the same time.  New Employee Orientation (NEO)  NEO provides new employees with information about Maricopa County such as: history, organizational structure, Merit Rules, County policies and procedures, County pay system and benefits and employee programs.  Rewarding Ideas/Employee Suggestions  Employees are provided with incentives to generate ideas for improvements that result in cost reduction through increased efficiency and productivity, improved processes and procedures and elimination of duplication and waste.
